EFT OBS KAPPA TRACKER - QUICK SETUP GUIDE
===============================================================================

FOR YOUR FRIENDS:
Send them this entire folder and tell them to follow these simple steps:

===============================================================================
STEP 1: INSTALL NODE.JS (If not already installed)
===============================================================================

1. Go to: https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Restart your computer after installation

===============================================================================
STEP 2: INSTALL THE TRACKER
===============================================================================

1. Double-click "install.bat"
2. Wait for it to complete (may take a few minutes)
3. You should see "INSTALLATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!"

If it fails:
- Make sure Node.js is installed (open Command Prompt and type: node --version)
- Make sure you have internet connection (needs to download packages)

===============================================================================
STEP 3: START THE TRACKER
===============================================================================

1. Double-click "start.bat"
2. A window will open showing the server is running
3. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000
4. Start tracking your Kappa quests!

DON'T CLOSE THE WINDOW - it needs to stay open while you use the tracker!
